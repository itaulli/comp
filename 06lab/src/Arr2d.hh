// This simple class illustrates creation of numpy arrays from user data.
// The "examplecalculate" function fills the data array with some values,
// and then the "convert" function creates the numpy array of the results.
//
// In addition to serving as a SWIG illustration, this class also manages
// the memory buffers needed to solve the boundary value problems in two
// dimensions. If you inherit your own class from this one, you will not
// have to reimplement that functionality.
